## Routing Configuration

By default, routes are loaded from the `<project-root>/pages` folder, where `<project-root>` refers to the `root` setting in `vite.config.js`. The route paths are **dynamically inferred from the directory structure**, very much like Next.js and Nuxt.js.

### Dynamic parameters

Dynamic route parameters follow the [Next.js convention](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#pages-with-dynamic-routes) (`[param]`), but that can be overriden by using the `paramPattern` plugin option. For example, this configuration switches the param pattern to the [Remix convention](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/routing#dynamic-segments) (`$param`).

```js
// ...
const plugins = [
  // ...
  viteVueFastifyDX({ paramPattern: /\$(\w+)/ }),
]
```

### Routes location

You can also change the glob pattern used to determine where to route modules from. 

Since this setting is passed to [Vite's glob importers](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#glob-import), the value needs to be a string:

```js
// ...
const plugins = [
  // ...
  viteVueFastifyDX({ globPattern: '/views/**/*.vue' }),
]
```

### View modules

You also can export a `path` constant from your route modules, in which case its value will be used to **override the dynamically inferred paths from the directory structure**. 

Additionally, [**you can provide your own routes**](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-dx/tree/dev/packages/fastify-dx-svelte#dxroutesjs).

```jsx
<template>
  <p>Route with path export</p>
</template>

<script>
export const path = '/my-page'
</script>
```
